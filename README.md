# Single Cycle CPU Project

This is a ModelSim project that implements a single cycle CPU using Verilog.
## Phase 1

- PC (Program Counter): The program counter is responsible for keeping track of the current instruction being executed.
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on the data.
- Adder: The adder is used to increment the program counter.
- Instruction Memory: The instruction memory stores the instructions to be executed.
## Phase 2

- Mux (Multiplexer): The multiplexer is used to select the correct data path for the instruction.
- Shift: The shift operation is used to shift the data.
- Register File: The register file stores the data.
- Sign Extend: The sign extend operation is used to extend the sign of the data.
- Data Memory: The data memory stores the data.
## Requirements

- ModelSim
- Verilog compiler
- A basic understanding of Verilog and digital logic
